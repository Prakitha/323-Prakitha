PROBLEM-7
Design a Customer class that has two attributes name and a numeric password.
It should have a method login that accepts two parameters and have logic such that if it matches the name and password that is stored,
it should print a message "login successful".
NOTE: 
In addition to the Customer class, you should write the Main(A1Hotel or A1Shopping) class,
 where you will create the customer objects and invoke the login
